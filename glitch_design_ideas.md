# Glitch Design Ideas for Succinct Crab Catcher

## Visual Effects

### Color Scheme
- Neon purple/pink as primary colors (matching Succinct branding)
- Electric blue accents
- Glowing green terminal text
- High contrast black backgrounds
- Occasional color distortion/shifting

### Glitch Effects
- Screen tearing effects when catching crabs
- Digital noise/static overlays during gameplay
- Pixel sorting on game elements
- Text corruption/scrambling on score display
- RGB splitting on main character
- Scanlines across the entire game
- Occasional screen "jitters" and "jumps"

### Dev+ Elements
- Terminal-style text and interfaces
- Floating code snippets in background
- Matrix-style falling code in transitions
- Hexadecimal numbers appearing randomly
- Command line prompts in UI elements
- ASCII art for game over screens
- Binary patterns in background elements

### Animation Ideas
- Glitchy teleportation effects for crabs
- Databending effects when collecting logos
- Corrupted frame transitions between screens
- Flickering elements that appear/disappear
- Warping effects on game boundaries
- Datamoshing when high scores are achieved

## Sound Effects

### Gameplay Sounds
- 8-bit retro bleeps and bloops
- Digital glitch sounds when catching crabs
- Static/interference noises for background
- Synthesizer zaps for movement
- Error message sounds for collisions
- Dial-up modem sounds for special events
- Corrupted audio samples for power-ups

### UI Sounds
- Keyboard typing sounds for text
- Old computer startup sounds for game initialization
- Digital "whoosh" for menu transitions
- Low-fi clicks for button presses
- Distorted confirmation tones for wallet connection
- Synthesized success sounds for transactions
- Corrupted voice samples saying "Succinct"

### Background Music
- Glitchy synthwave loops
- Low-fi beats with occasional corruption
- Ambient electronic with data processing sounds
- Chiptune with random pitch/tempo glitches
- Generative algorithmic music that changes with gameplay

## Implementation Approach

### CSS Techniques
- CSS animations for simple glitch effects
- CSS filters for color manipulation
- Clip-path for tearing effects
- Mix-blend-mode for overlay effects
- Animation keyframes with random timing

### JavaScript Effects
- Canvas manipulation for pixel-level effects
- WebGL shaders for advanced visual glitches
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Audio API for sound generation and manipulation
- Random timing functions for unpredictable glitches

### Assets
- Pre-rendered glitch effect spritesheets
- SVG filters for real-time distortion
- WebM video backgrounds with glitch compilations
- MP3/WAV sound effects library
- JSON-based effect sequencing

## Special Features
